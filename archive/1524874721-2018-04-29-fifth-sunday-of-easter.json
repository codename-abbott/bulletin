   "text": "The Gospel we hear today is from the famous verses taken from the heart of John's presenting Jesus giving His last discourse to His apostles. We hear one more of the \"I am\" statements, characteristic of John's presentation of Jesus. As with the other \"I am\" references, Jesus is telling His listeners who they are as well. He also gives an image of His Father. There is much identifying then in today's readings. Paul finds out who he is and we find out a bit of who we are.\n\nThe image of \"vine\", \"vine grower\", and \"branch\" is a tactile as well as visual aid. We are the receivers of life and the producers of \"fruit\" as long as we remain in Him Who has remained in us. \"Fruit\" is the product of His penetrating our earthliness. What we do will flower from remaining faithful to who we are. We are more than what we do, of course, but doing is more than a revelation of ourselves.\n\nThe \"Grower\" is pictured as the One Who trims away those who have refused their identity as branches; perhaps they want to be the \"vine\" themselves. By their choices they are cut away and lost to the process of bringing life and nourishment through Christ, into this world. The Trimmer is seen to prune the branches so that even more fruit may grow. I do not like hearing this, because I do not like being shaped up.\n\nI am a jogger and I try to eat properly and that is hard enough. Being trimmed, corrected, advised, admonished, told how to do things differently from my usual and proper way, these are troublesome. It is very hard to hear them, even from good friends, but from the \"Untrimmed Trimmer\" well, they still hurt.\n\nPaul was grafted onto and into the Vine. By Baptism, we too have become grounded in Jesus as well. Paul had to live with his earthliness, his past, his violence. Many of the great saints have had to live beyond their histories. The community had to receive Paul who had been a block to the \"Way\" and then instead of being in the way, he was on the \"Way\". He learned of the redemptive mission of Jesus, not like the other disciples, at the feet of Jesus. Paul became a disciple by learning, by getting knocked off his own feet by the Trimmer's pruning voice.\n\nWe learn from our mistakes - well, kind of. We learn and grow from them if we allow ourselves to be met by, no not Jesus first, but by ourselves first. We first come to sense that our lives are not fruitful, the way Jesus encourages life to be. All kinds of things grow on vines: grapes of course; but also peas, tomatoes, watermelons, zucchini, and flowers as well. If I envy the ivy and disown myself as a pumpkin, then I shrivel and die. Being apart from Jesus means not being a part of Jesus as Vine.\"Apart from Jesus\" usually results in our not being the branch the Trimmer planted on this earth at this time. Jesus had to meet Saul in order that Saul could meet himself, his truth. From this learning experience, Paul became an Apostle, that is, one who is sent. His fruitfulness blossomed after he accepted who he was. The original disciples had to accept him as well, because of his having become alive in the Spirit and his own truth.\n\n\"The Resurrection was like an explosion of light, an explosion of love which dissolved the hitherto indissoluble compenetration of dying and becoming. It ushered in a new dimension of being, a new dimension of life in which, in a transformed way, matter too was integrated and through which a new world emerges.\" Pope Benedict, Easter Vigil Homily 2006",
