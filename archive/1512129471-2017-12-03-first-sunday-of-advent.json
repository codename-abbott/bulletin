   "title": "First Sunday of Advent",
   "text": "This weekend the Church enters into the liturgical season of Advent. Christians proclaim that the Messiah has indeed come and that God's reign is \"at hand.\"\n\nAdvent does not change God. Advent deepens our longing and anticipation that God will do what prophets and the anointed have promised. We pray that God will yield to our need to see and feel the promise of salvation here and now.\n\nDuring this time of longing and waiting for the Lord, we are invited to pray and to ponder the Word of God, but most of all, to become a reflection of the light of Christ, indeed of Christ himself. But we all know how difficult it is to mirror the light of Christ, especially when we have become disillusioned with life, accustomed to the shadowy existence of the world, or grown content with mediocrity and emptiness. Advent reminds us that we must be ready to meet the Lord at any and every moment of life. Just like a security alarm wakes up a homeowner, Advent wakes up Christians who are in danger of sleeping through their lives.\n\nAdvent is a time for opening eyes, focusing views, paying attention, keeping perspective on God's presence in the world and in our own lives.\n\nIn the first reading from the prophet Isaiah on the first Sunday of Advent, the Almighty One breathes hope back into the heart and soul of Israel and shapes Israel and events anew just as a potter shapes his pottery. In the second Scripture reading, writing to his beloved community at Corinth, Paul looked forward to the \"Day of the Lord\" when the Lord Jesus will be revealed to rescue those whom He has called. And in the Gospel for the first Sunday of Advent this year, Mark's depiction of the doorkeeper watching out for the Lord whenever he \"suddenly\" appears is an image of what we are expected to be doing all year long but especially during the season of Advent.\n\nOur own baptism is a share in the royal, messianic mission of Jesus. Anyone who shares this mission also shares royal responsibilities, in particular, care for the afflicted and the hurting. Advent is a wonderful opportunity to \"activate\" our baptismal promises and commitment.\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger once wrote: *The purpose of the Church's year is continually to rehearse her great history of memories, to awaken the heart's memory so that it can discern the star of hope. It is the beautiful task of Advent to awaken in all of us, memories of goodness and thus to open doors of hope.*\n\nThis Advent, allow me to suggest that you mend a quarrel. Build peace. Seek out a forgotten friend. Dismiss suspicion and replace it with trust. Write a love letter. Share some treasure. Give a kind answer even though you would like to respond harshly. Encourage a young person to believe in him/herself. Manifest your loyalty in word and deed. Keep a promise. Find the time. Make time. Forego a grudge. Forgive an enemy. Celebrate the sacrament of reconciliation. Listen more. Apologize if you were wrong. Be kind even if you weren't wrong!\n\nTry to understand. Flout envy. Examine the demands you make on others. Think first of someone else. Appreciate. Be kind, be gentle. Laugh a little. Laugh a little more. Deserve confidence. Take up arms against malice. Decry complacency. Express gratitude. Go to Church. Stay in Church a little while longer than usual. Gladden the heart of a child. Take pleasure in the beauty and wonder of the earth. Speak your love. Speak it once again. Speak it even more loudly. Speak it quietly.\nRejoice, for the Lord is near!",
