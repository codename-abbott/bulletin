   "text": "Today Jesus calls us to a love like his, a love of service.  He calls us to\nlove like our heavenly Father who is benevolent and who shows no partiality. He\ncalls us to love as he loved, meaning to be filled with love for one another.\nThe disciple of Christ is not primarily an individual person but an\ninter-person. He is always at the service of the other. Hence Jesus gives us\nthe new commandment to love other people he has loved us.  The divine command\nis to love God with our whole heart and soul and so on; and to love our\nneighbours as ourselves. Jesus has added a new element in telling us that the\ntrue test of discipleship is to love other people in the same way that he has\nloved us. His love was the sacrificial love where he gave his life for us. The\ndisciples are now called upon to build the faith of others and we see how\nmarvellous the living faith of the early Church was.\n\nGenerally the word love is used by us mainly in contexts which imply deep\naffection, emotional attraction and a good feeling when the beloved is around\nor even just thought of. That is not quite the meaning of the word in this\ncontext. In the present context, which is the time after the washing of the\nfeet of the disciples, the word love implies a reaching out to others in a\ncaring attitude for their well-being, irrespective of whether there will be a\nsimilar response by the other. It is the compassion that Jesus shows for the\nsinner and the evil person. He even washed the feet of Judas. It is why the\ntrue Christian disciple does not in fact have enemies. This is what Jesus is\ndoing in praying for forgiveness for those who were nailing him to the cross.\nHe loves them not as close friends obviously, but as people who truly needed\nenlightenment about what they were doing not just to him but to themselves.\nJesus cared for each and every person. Jesus’ attention here in the farewell\ndiscourse, as well as John’s attention in his epistles, is on the crucial stage\nof promoting the love between disciples. The community is to continue to\nmanifest God as Jesus has done, thereby shining as a light in the world.\n\nWe are the disciples of Jesus and his true followers. But to fulfil this call\nwe certainly have to pass through real tests as Jesus did to his apostles. The\nword that Jesus uses is love or charity. This involves loving a person\nsincerely and with ones heart and does not just remain at giving things or\nmonetary help. It is a service of the heart which Jesus did. He who truly loves\nhis neighbour must be concerned with those things relating to the purpose of\none’s life and earning his eternal salvation. The Love of Christ in the Church\nis received as precious gift. It also needs be demonstrated in accordance with\nChrist’s command to love one another. Love will be the mark of the community\nleft behind after Christ has departed. He promises the gift of the Spirit, but\nthat is a gift of empowerment to fulfil his mission on earth. All this is based\non Love. Love is the basis of Christian discipleship and the motivation of\nChristian action. Love makes a Christian distinct person. Above all as St Paul\nsays Christ is Love. Thus, Christians are called to live, and to love each\nother, as Jesus did: “As I loved you, you also like you the ones the others.”\nIf Jesus is in the Father for a mutual love, then Jesus must also come into\neach one of us for a common and universal love! Already, through Eucharistic\ncommunion, we can anticipate our ascent into Heaven!  The Most Blessed Virgin\nMary understood this very well: when she saw Jesus rising up into Heaven, in\nthe Glory of God, she followed her Divine Son in spirit, she held him in her\nmemory forever, in order to remain forever with Him.\n",
