   "text": "***We'd like to wish all of our parishioners, whether worshiping with us here at ICCH or travelling the globe to be with their loved ones, a very blessed Christmas time - let the light born in Bethlehem shine in your lives! And we hope to see you all again, happy and healthy, in the new year 2018!***\n\n   \n---\n\n.\n\n**Reflection**\n\nThe Gospel for Christmas Day begins with a kind of Hymn. We are called to listen intently to the words as they deepen our understanding of the Mystery hidden in Jesus\n\n*“In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God.”*\n\nIn words of utter simplicity Jesus is described as the ONE Word which God has always spoken.  This Word has now reached its fulfilment in the life of Jesus.  It is as though we are learning that all the previous words of Scripture - the narratives of Creation, the history of the Israelites, the words of the Prophets, the Psalms, Wisdom Literature have now found their meaning in the Person of Jesus, *“the true Light that gives Light to every person was coming into the world.”*\n\nIn the words of this Gospel Jesus is described as the Life and Light and Glory of God. Most of all this Word of God was made flesh in order that God might reveal Himself to us! We are brought to know the Father through the Son: *“and the Word was with God”. A more accurate translation is “the Word is turned to the Father and the Father is turned to the Word.”* Jesus becomes visible and tangible. All humankind is caught up in this glance, this gaze of love. From all time God has waited to speak to us, to tell us of his Love. This Love becomes incarnate in the love-filled life of Jesus.\n\nThe Word made Flesh has made his dwelling among us in utter simplicity. He comes from the Father *“full of grace and truth.”*  In Jesus we meet God.\n\n*“No one has ever seen God.”* Jesus is the human face of God. *”The one who is at the Father’s side has made Him known.”* In order to meet Jesus we must make ourselves small. We must ask Jesus to help us see with his eyes even in the face of rejection: *”He came to that which was His own and His own did not receive Him”*.\n\nHe comes to each one of us to give us His Life. He will help us when we fail to recognize Him so long as we stay turned towards him. He is dwelling among us: *“Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God”*.\n\nIn the words of Pope Francis: *“Contemplating his humble and infinite love, let us simply tell him: Thank you,  Thank you because you have done all this for me.\"*",
