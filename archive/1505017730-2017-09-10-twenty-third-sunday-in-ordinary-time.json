   "text": "To love of others requires a capacity to experience\nanother person as a person. This is not easy; we\nnormally see others as we see objects and things,\nas facts, not as persons. We can also speak of\ncategories of persons, groups, classes, and even\nwant to speak in their name, and perhaps never\nexperience anyone of those abstract groups as a\npersonal. Love is the only adequate response of\nour capacity to relate to persons, yet how difficult\nwe find it just to experience even one person as a\nperson.There is a clear duty to make oneself\nresponsible for others’ actions. Ezekiel warns us\nthat if we do not warn others of their evil ways we\nwill be held responsible for their spiritual death.\nThe Gospel advice runs in the same vein. It is not difficult to see the connection between this fraternal\ncorrection and the Gospel precept of love for neighbor. A true love for neighbor and a true knowledge\nof the nature and the harm of sin leave no other option. To love God with all one’s mind and heart\nrequires searching for God with all one’s mind and heart. This means the time and a readiness to search\nfor and know God’s presence and will. It means a whole-hearted willingness to search for God\nwherever he may be found.\n\nToday in the church Jesus places on us the painful obligation of fraternal love in the watchful love we\nshow towards others. To approach this painful duty of fraternal correction, it entails many qualities:\ncourage, compassion, patience, gentleness, humility, sincerity, reverence, a desire to preserve the\nother’s good name, prudence, delicacy, tact, mutual dialogue,true listening and mercy. The readings tell\nus that we will be held responsible for the silence and our unwillingness to speak. We are scandalized\nand even annoyed when our leaders in the church or community do not speak. But Jesus tells us today\nthat we have to speak for him and rectify the wrong in the society and the community. We are there not\nmerely to criticize but to help positively to build bridges and rectify the wrong. This week, let us take\nsome time to reflect on our responsibility towards God. Let us reflect on how we will account to God\nfor the actions of those around us, be it our parents, our brothers or sisters, our children, our relatives,\nour neighbours, our co-workers, our peers, all of those whose life we touch. Let us do what we must do\nso that when we appear before God on Judgment Day, we will be able to repeat the words of Jesus,\n“Not one of them was lost except the one destined to be lost.”",
